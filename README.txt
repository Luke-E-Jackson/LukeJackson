Instead of continuing to work on my portfolio website, I've decided to take out some time to
relearn html and css from the ground up. This may take several days so I am postponing the progress
of this website as of now. I will continue to do small updates and fixes however, because the work
I'm doing on my practice website won't be hosted and I'll use this README to list my accomplishments.

1: made a html + css website from scratch that is the exact same as an example picture. Without seeing any code.
