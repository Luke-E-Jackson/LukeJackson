Hey this is my portfolio website. I'm using it to host an about me page, project page, and contact page.
I'm currently working on some networking and cybersecurity projects in addition to this website. 
It's a work in progress but I did it all from scratch because I like learning how things work.

1/14/2025 - Instead of continuing to work on my portfolio website, I've decided to take out some time to
relearn html and css from the ground up. This may take several days so I am postponing the progress
of this website as of now. I will continue to do small updates and fixes however, because the work
I'm doing on my practice website won't be hosted and I'll use this README to list my progress.

1: made a html + css website from scratch that is the exact same as an example picture. Without seeing any code.

2: 1/16/2025 - I've made it through 26 html and css videos and from that information I made several major arrangement changes
to my portfolio website. I'm still working on a project file in addition to the website, but I have decided to make changes as
I notice things that need to be changed with the original portfolio site.

3: 1/17/2025 - I finished a 50 video playlist on html and css. Using that information I made some 
changes to this website to make it more responsive. I also changed the colors and added a wrapper.

4: 1/17/2025 - Purchased a custom url and added that to the website. Added my new email through this domain as well.
